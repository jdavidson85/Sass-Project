            <h4>After a nail-biting 99-day stalemate, the MLB and the MLBPA have come to a tentative agreement, allowing baseball to begin its 2022 season and it'll look slightly different than it did in 2021.</h4>

            <p>Ken Griffey Jr and Derek Jeter are two of my favorite baseball players of all time. These two individuals inspired millions of young kids to play baseball. I've collected a lot of their baseball cards myself and have always loved these two athletes for their raw ability to play the game of baseball. I loved the way Ken Griffey Jr Swung the bat and those majestic home runs he hit. I loved the way Derek Jeter played defense and how he would go deep in the infield to throw runners out at first base.</p>
